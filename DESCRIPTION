Description: This package deals with RCON models for paired data and implements an Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve a penalized likelihood method. Also functions for the computation of maximum likelihood estimates and for the generation of simulated pdRCON models and data are provided.
