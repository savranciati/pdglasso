Description: This package implements a symmetric graphical lasso procedure to solve a penalized inference problem of analyzing paired data under the class of coloured graphical models. In particular, it deals with RCON models, where constraints are put on the concentration matrix. Estimation is performed through the alternating directions method of multipliers.
